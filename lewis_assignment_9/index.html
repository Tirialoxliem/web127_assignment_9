    <h1>What Is Your Favorite?</h1>
    <p class="flex-wrap" id="p1">
      Everybody has a favorite of everything. This site was built to see what
      things are most popular as favorites. We are still in the process of
      adding more categories, so check back often to add your answers to our
      poll questions. Our current pages are geared towards what are the type's
      of foods that are people's favorites, what are people's favorite colors,
      and what are people's favorite activities. The answers to the questions
      help businesses figure out what items people like the most, so they can
      gear their future products towards things that people like. Thank you for
      all the help with these projects.
